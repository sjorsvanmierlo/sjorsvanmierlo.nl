Hi, I'm Sjors. I'm a Software Engineer from the south of the Netherlands. I am currently hired as an Android Developer at the Volksbank where I work on the banking apps for all of the brands of the Volksbank!

I am a social, critical and inquisitive professional and get excited about cool software! I am eager to pick up challenging tasks or projects with great enthusiasm. 

In my spare time I like to keep learning new things by reading books, blogs, watching videos and listening to podcasts that are related to Software Engineering.

The past 10 years I have been working on various Android projects that allowed me to work with Java and for the last  years in Kotlin. Currently I am shifting my career to move to backend development with Java (or Kotlin).
